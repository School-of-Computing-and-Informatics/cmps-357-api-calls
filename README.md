## 🎨 Color Scheme

Designed specifically for projector presentations:

- **Background**: Dark navy (`#1a1a2e`) - easy on the eyes
- **Primary Accent**: Bright green (`#16db93`) - high visibility
- **Secondary Accent**: Orange (`#f39c12`) - good contrast
- **Text**: Light gray (`#eee`) - optimal readability
- **Panels**: Deep blue (`#0f3460`) - subtle depth

## 🔧 Technical Features

### API Services Used
1. **Primary**: `rss2json.com` - Free, CORS-enabled RSS to JSON API
2. **Fallback**: `rsstojson.com` via CORS proxy - Alternative service
3. **Demo Mode**: Mock data when APIs are blocked (development environments)

### Error Handling
- Network failure detection
- Service fallback mechanisms
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation to demo mode

### Data Processing
- HTML tag stripping for clean display
- Date formatting for readability
- Content truncation for manageable display
- JSON prettification for raw data view

## 📖 Example RSS Feeds

The application includes these pre-configured feeds:

- **📰 BBC News**: `https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml`
- **📰 NY Times US News**: `https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/US.xml`
- **💻 TechCrunch**: `https://techcrunch.com/feed/`
